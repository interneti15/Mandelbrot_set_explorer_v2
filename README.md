A second version to my previous Mandelbrot_set_explorer fully rewitten and optimized. Moving through fractal is now very intuitive.

Grab and move to go up/down/left/right and mouse wheel up/down to zoom/unzoom.

Written purely in C++.

Additional libraries are:
  -Boost (1_82_0) https://www.boost.org/
  -SFML https://www.sfml-dev.org/

Compiling the project in Debug mode does not work(and idc enough)

Designed to use all cpu threads!
So 100% CPU usage is to be expected
